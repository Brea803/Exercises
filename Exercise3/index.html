	<p>Time isn't real but, it controls everything around us. It's is man-made and man made time to have control. Control over how long a person can work, play, take tests, create a baby; basically everything. The more your pay attention to it the slower it moves. The less attention you give it the easier it is to lose it. But, what would happen if time didn't exist? Would anything get done?</p>
