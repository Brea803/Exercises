		I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,</br>
		From the seas and the streams; 
		I bear light shade for the leaves when laid 
		In their noonday dreams.</br>
		From my <input type="text" name="txt1" /> are shaken the dews that waken 
		The sweet buds every one, 
		When rocked to rest on their mother's</br> 
		breast, 
		As she dances about the sun. 
		I wield the flail of the lashing hail, 
		And whiten the green plains under, 
		And then again I</br>  
		dissolve it in rain, 
		And laugh as I pass in thunder.

		I sift the snow on the mountains below,</br>  
		And their great pines groan aghast;  
		And all the night
		 'tis my pillow white, </br> 
		While I sleep in the arms of the blast. 
		Sublime on
		 the towers of my skiey bowers, </br> 
		Lightning my pilot sits;	In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,
		It struggles and howls at fits;</br>  
		Over earth and ocean, with <input type="text" name="txt2"/> motion, 
		This pilot is guiding me,
		Lured by the love of the genii </br>  that move 
		In the depths of the purple sea;
		Over the rills, 
		 and the crags,</br> 
		  and the hills, 
		Over the lakes and the plains,  
		Wherever he dream,</br>  under mountain or stream, 
		The Spirit he loves remains; </br> 
		And I all the while bask in Heaven'  
		blue smile, </br> 
		Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

		The 
		<input type="text" name="txt3"/> Sunrise,</br> 
		with his meteor eyes, And 
		his burning plumes</br>  outspread, 
		Leaps on the back 
		 of my sailing rack, 
		When the morning</br>  star shines dead; 
		As on the jag of a mountain crag, 
		Which an earthquake rocks and swings,</br>  
		An eagle alit one moment may sit 
		In the light of its golden wings.</br>  
		And when Sunset may breathe,</br>

		 from the lit sea beneath,</br> 	Its ardours of rest
		and of love, 
		And the crimson pall of eve may fall 
		From</br>  the depth of Heaven above,	With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest, 
		As still as a brooding <input type="text" name="txt4"/>. </br> 

		That orbèd maiden with white fire laden, 
		Whom mortals call the Moon, 
		Glides glimmering o'er my </br> 
		fleece-like floor, 
		By the midnight breezes strewn; 
		And wherever the beat of her unseen feet, </br> 
		Which only the <input type="text" name="txt5"/> hear, 
		May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof, </br> 
		The stars peep behind her and peer; 
		And I laugh to see them whirl and flee, </br> 
		Like a swarm of golden bees, 
		When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,</br>   
		Till calm the rivers, lakes, and <input type="text" name="txt6"/>, 
		Like strips</br>  of the sky fallen through me on high,
		Are</br>  each paved with the moon and these. </br>

		I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone, 
		And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl; 
		The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim, 
		When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl. 
		From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape, 
		Over a torrent sea, 
		Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof, 
		The mountains its columns be. 
		The triumphal arch through which I march 
		With hurricane, fire, and snow, 
		When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair, 
		Is the million-coloured bow; 
		The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove, 
		While the moist Earth was laughing below. 

		I am the

		through the pores of the ocean and shores; 
		I change, but I cannot die. 
		For after the rain when with never a stain 
		The pavilion of Heaven is bare, 
		And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams 
		Build up the blue dome of air, 
		I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, 
		And out of the caverns of rain,
